# Working Groups

As part of the Brick Consortium, a set of working groups have been established
to organize community contributions and feedback around different aspects of
the Brick ontology. There are two meetings of each working group: one in the
morning (Pacific) and one in the evening (Pacific) so that there is a
reasonable time to join for most parts of the world.

Working groups may discuss:
- additions, extensions and fixes to the Brick ontology definition. This includes, but is not limited to, new classes, modeling domains, changes to the ontology structure, and documentation for Brick.
- developing, testing and documenting open-source software that facilitates use of Brick.  This includes software for producing Brick models from existing representations and software/libraries/databases for  querying, managing and storing Brick models.  For data, the group also gathers, develops and documents example Brick models (both for full buildings as well as individual systems) and building data sets that can inform research and illustrate idiomatic use of Brick.
- anything else that comes up!

Working groups meet:
- Every second Wednesday, from 6:00 - 7:00 PM, Pacific Time on [Zoom](https://mines.zoom.us/j/96983354945?pwd=cGJ5OWpTRnplandlOFQyd2tKWXB1UT09)
